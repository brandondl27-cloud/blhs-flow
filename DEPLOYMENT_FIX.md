# ðŸ”§ Quick Deployment Fix Applied

**Problem:** Vercel build failed with "Could not load /client/src/pages/Tasks" error

**Solution:** Fixed import statements in `App.tsx` to include `.tsx` extensions

### Next Steps:
1. **Replace the files** on your GitHub repository with this updated version
2. **Push to GitHub** (this will trigger automatic Vercel rebuild)
3. **Vercel will successfully build** and deploy your app

### Updated Files:
- âœ… `client/src/App.tsx` - Fixed all import statements
- âœ… All other files remain the same

## ðŸ”„ How to Update Your Repository

**Option 1: Replace via GitHub Web**
1. Delete all files from your GitHub repository
2. Upload all files from this updated package
3. Commit changes - Vercel will auto-rebuild

**Option 2: Force Push (if using Git)**
```bash
git rm -r . --cached
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Updated imports with .tsx extensions for Vercel build"

```

After updating your repository:

The fix ensures proper module resolution during the production build process.
